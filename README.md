## Overview

BCBS Values is a comprehensive system for valuing real estate properties in Benton County, Washington. It combines data from multiple sources including MLS listings, NARRPR data, and PACS (Property Assessment & Collection System) to provide accurate, data-driven property valuations.

The system employs both basic and advanced machine learning-based valuation models to estimate property values based on various features including square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, property age, and GIS spatial data.

## Key Features

- **Multi-source ETL Pipeline**: Extracts, transforms, and loads data from MLS, NARRPR, and PACS sources
- **Intelligent Valuation Engine**: Uses multiple modeling approaches including:
  - Linear regression with advanced feature engineering
  - Gradient boosting with LightGBM for superior prediction accuracy
  - Ensemble methods combining multiple model types
- **Advanced GIS Integration**: Incorporates geographic and spatial data for location-based valuation
- **BS Army of Agents**: Autonomous agent architecture for distributed processing and monitoring
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Web-based interface for exploring valuations and running what-if analyses
- **Comprehensive API**: RESTful endpoints for accessing property data and valuations
- **Benton County Focus**: Specialized for the Benton County, WA real estate market

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with the following high-level components:

1. **Data Acquisition Layer**: ETL components that extract data from various sources
2. **Persistence Layer**: PostgreSQL database for storage 
3. **Processing Layer**: Valuation engine and BS Army of Agents
4. **Presentation Layer**: Web interface and API endpoints

The application runs through a Flask web server (port 5001) for the user interface and a FastAPI server (port 5000) for API endpoints.

## Key Modules

### ETL Pipeline

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline is responsible for:

- Extracting raw property data from MLS, NARRPR, and PACS systems
- Transforming the data into a unified format with validation checks
- Loading validated data into the PostgreSQL database

The pipeline can be run in validation-only mode to check data quality without loading it into the database.

### Valuation Engine

The valuation engine:

- Implements multiple property valuation models:
  - Basic linear regression model
  - Enhanced multiple regression with advanced feature engineering
  - Gradient boosting with LightGBM for superior accuracy
  - Ensemble model that combines linear regression and LightGBM
- Uses features like square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, and location
- Calculates confidence scores and prediction intervals
- Identifies comparable properties for validation
- Supports GIS (Geographic Information System) data integration

The valuation engine includes comprehensive model selection and evaluation:
- Feature normalization using StandardScaler for better numerical stability
- Multiple feature selection methods (f_regression, mutual_info, RFE, random_forest)
- Regularization options (Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet) for linear models
- Cross-validation for robust performance evaluation
- Statistical significance reporting with p-values for model coefficients

The valuation results include feature importance metrics to explain which factors most influenced the estimated value, with different techniques depending on the model type (coefficient-based for linear models, gain-based for tree models).

### BS Army of Agents

The BS (Benton County System) Army of Agents consists of specialized autonomous agents:

- **BCBS Bootstrap Commander**: Manages the initialization and dependency verification
- **BCBS Cascade Operator**: Handles data flow and transformations
- **BCBS TDD Validator**: Ensures code quality and test coverage

Each agent has real-time status monitoring and performance metrics available in the Agent Dashboard.

### Dashboard

The web dashboard includes:

- Property search and filtering
- Detailed property valuation views
- What-If analysis for exploring feature impact
- Agent monitoring and status visualization
- ETL process validation results

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- PostgreSQL 13 or later
- Node.js 18+ (for React components)
- API credentials for data sources:
  - NARRPR username and password
  - PACS API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bcbs-values.git
   cd bcbs-values
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables (create a `.env` file):
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/bcbs_values
   SESSION_SECRET=your_secret_key
   NARRPR_USERNAME=your_narrpr_username
   NARRPR_PASSWORD=your_narrpr_password
   PACS_API_KEY=your_pacs_api_key
   BCBS_VALUES_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

4. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python -c "from db.database import Database; db = Database(); db.create_tables()"
   ```
   
5. Set up API key for authentication:
   ```bash
   ./set_api_key.sh your_api_key
   ```

### Configuration

Configuration files are stored in the `configs/` directory:

- `database_config.json`: Database connection settings
- `etl_config.json`: ETL pipeline configuration
- `module_config.json`: Core module configuration

Modify these files to adjust system behavior according to your needs.

## Workflow Setup

The system uses Replit workflows to manage long-running tasks such as the API server and the web application. Workflows are defined in `.replit.workflow/` directory.

To use workflows:

1. Access the Replit workflow menu in the top-right corner of the Replit interface
2. Select the desired workflow (API or WebApp)
3. Click "Run" to start the workflow

Available workflows:

- **API**: Starts the FastAPI server for accessing the valuation endpoints
- **WebApp**: Starts the Flask web application for the user interface
- **EnhancedAPI**: Runs the version with enhanced GIS integration
- **BasicAPI**: Runs a simpler version without database requirements
- **ValuationAPI**: Specifically for valuation endpoints
- **TestAPI**: For testing API functionality

See the `WORKFLOW_SETUP.md` file for more details on configuring and using workflows.

## Usage Guide

### Running the ETL Pipeline

Run the ETL pipeline with the following command:

```bash
# Run the full ETL pipeline for all data sources
python main.py --sources all

# Run ETL for specific sources only
python main.py --sources pacs mls

# Run in validate-only mode (no data loading)
python main.py --sources all --validate-only
```

The ETL process will:
1. Extract data from the specified sources
2. Transform and validate the data
3. Load valid data into the database (unless in validate-only mode)
4. Generate a validation report as a JSON file

### Accessing API Endpoints

We provide two separate API implementations to accommodate different needs:

#### Simple Valuation API (Recommended)

The Simple Valuation API is optimized for stability and doesn't require database access:

```bash
# Easiest method:
./run_simple_api.sh

# Or start directly with more control:
./start_simple_api.sh
```

The Simple API will be available at `http://localhost:5002` with these endpoints:

- `GET /api/health`: Health check endpoint
- `POST /api/valuation`: Generate a property valuation
- `GET /api/neighborhoods`: Get neighborhood quality ratings
- `GET /api/reference-points`: Get GIS reference points

Example Simple API calls:

```bash
# Check API health
curl "http://localhost:5002/api/health"

# Generate a standard property valuation (linear model)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5002/api/valuation" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "square_feet": 2000,
    "bedrooms": 3,
    "bathrooms": 2.5,
    "year_built": 2005,
    "latitude": 46.2804,
    "longitude": -119.2752,
    "city": "Richland",
    "neighborhood": "Meadow Springs",
    "use_gis": true,
    "model_type": "linear"
  }'

# Generate a property valuation with LightGBM model
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5002/api/valuation" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "square_feet": 2000,
    "bedrooms": 3,
    "bathrooms": 2.5,
    "year_built": 2005,
    "latitude": 46.2804,
    "longitude": -119.2752,
    "city": "Richland",
    "neighborhood": "Meadow Springs",
    "use_gis": true,
    "model_type": "lightgbm",
    "feature_selection_method": "mutual_info"
  }'

# Generate a property valuation with ensemble model (linear + LightGBM)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5002/api/valuation" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "square_feet": 2000,
    "bedrooms": 3,
    "bathrooms": 2.5,
    "year_built": 2005,
    "latitude": 46.2804,
    "longitude": -119.2752,
    "city": "Richland",
    "neighborhood": "Meadow Springs",
    "use_gis": true,
    "model_type": "ensemble"
  }'
```

#### Full API (Advanced)

The full FastAPI implementation includes additional features but requires database connectivity:

```bash
# Start the API using the workflow system:
# Use the Replit workflow menu to start the API workflow
# 
# Or run directly:
./start_api_server.sh
# 
# Or using Python directly:
python run_api.py
```

The Full API will be available at `http://localhost:5000` with these endpoints:

- `GET /api/valuations`: Get property valuations with filtering options
- `GET /api/valuations/{property_id}`: Get valuation for a specific property
- `POST /api/valuations`: Generate a new property valuation (requires API key)
- `GET /api/etl-status`: Get the current status of the ETL process
- `GET /api/agent-status`: Get the status of the BS Army of Agents

Example API calls:

```bash
# Get a list of property valuations with filtering
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/valuations?limit=5&min_value=300000" -H "X-API-KEY: your_api_key_here"

# Generate a new property valuation with LightGBM model (requires authentication)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/valuations" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: your_api_key_here" \
  -d '{
    "address": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Richland",
    "state": "WA",
    "zip_code": "99352",
    "property_type": "Single Family",
    "bedrooms": 3,
    "bathrooms": 2,
    "square_feet": 1800,
    "lot_size": 8500,
    "year_built": 1995,
    "latitude": 46.2804,
    "longitude": -119.2752,
    "use_gis": true,
    "model_config": {
      "model_type": "lightgbm",
      "feature_selection": "auto",
      "feature_selection_method": "mutual_info",
      "normalize_features": true,
      "lightgbm_params": {
        "num_leaves": 31,
        "learning_rate": 0.05,
        "n_estimators": 100
      }
    }
  }'
```

The POST `/api/valuations` endpoint generates a new property valuation using our advanced valuation models, including GIS features when available. This endpoint requires authentication with an API key passed in the `X-API-KEY` header.
