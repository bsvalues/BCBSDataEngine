# Workflow Automation Development Plan

## Current Issues
1. Multiple workflows with the same name (WebApp) causing conflicts
2. Python path is not being explicitly set in the workflow
3. The run_diagnosis.sh script uses nix-shell which may not be available
4. Lack of clear tests for workflow functionality
5. No proper error handling or fallback mechanisms

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Basic Workflow Configuration 
1. Create a unified workflow definition with proper Python path
2. Update the WebApp workflow to use a specific Python executable path
3. Remove duplicate workflow definitions
4. Add proper error handling and logging

### Phase 2: Create Test Suite
1. Create a comprehensive test suite for the workflow
   - Test for Python environment availability
   - Test for application startup
   - Test for API endpoint functionality
   - Test for error cases and recovery
2. Create a test runner script that validates each component

### Phase 3: Implement Workflow Updates
1. Update .replit file with the corrected workflow definitions
2. Create a new workflow startup script
3. Implement the environment detection and setup
4. Add proper logging and error reporting

### Phase 4: Validation and Documentation
1. Run the test suite to validate all changes
2. Document the workflow configuration and usage
3. Create a troubleshooting guide
4. Review the changes and make final adjustments

## Success Criteria
1. Workflow starts up correctly without errors
2. Web application is accessible on expected port
3. All tests pass successfully
4. Error conditions are handled gracefully with appropriate logging
5. Documentation is complete and accurate
