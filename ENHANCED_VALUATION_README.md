# Enhanced Property Valuation Engine

## Overview

The Enhanced Property Valuation Engine is a sophisticated system that combines multiple advanced techniques to provide accurate and reliable property valuations. This document outlines the key features and capabilities of the enhanced valuation module.

## Key Features

### 1. Advanced Regression Techniques

The valuation engine now includes:
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Basic regression with feature transformations
- **Ridge Regression**: L2 regularization for stable predictions
- **Lasso Regression**: L1 regularization for feature selection
- **Elastic Net**: Combined L1 and L2 regularization
- **LightGBM Integration**: Gradient boosting for non-linear relationships
- **Model Comparison**: Automatic selection of the best performing model

### 2. Feature Normalization

All input features are normalized to ensure that variables with different scales don't disproportionately influence the model. This includes:
- Square footage normalization
- Property age normalization
- Bedroom and bathroom count normalization
- Lot size normalization

### 3. Spatial Adjustment via GIS Integration

The engine integrates with Geographic Information System (GIS) data to apply location-specific adjustments:
- School district quality assessment
- Neighborhood walkability scores
- Proximity to amenities
- Flood risk assessment
- Location-specific multipliers

### 4. Robust Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Missing property attributes
- Invalid data values
- External service failures
- Graceful fallbacks to simpler models when needed

### 5. Detailed Performance Metrics

Each valuation includes detailed performance metrics:
- R-squared values
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
- Confidence scores
- Feature importance analysis
- Prediction intervals

### 6. What-If Analysis

The system supports "what-if" analysis to simulate changes to property characteristics:
- Assess impact of property improvements
- Evaluate neighborhood changes
- Quantify the value of specific upgrades
- Individual and combined parameter impact assessment

## Usage Examples

### Basic Valuation

```python
from src.valuation import perform_valuation

# Create a property object
property = Property(
    address='123 Main St',
    square_feet=2000,
    bedrooms=3,
    bathrooms=2,
    lot_size=0.25,
    year_built=1985,
    property_type='single_family',
    neighborhood='ballard',
    latitude=47.6205,
    longitude=-122.3493
)

# Perform valuation
valuation = perform_valuation(property, valuation_method='auto')

# Access the results
estimated_value = valuation['estimated_value']
confidence_score = valuation['confidence_score']
method_used = valuation['valuation_method']
```

### What-If Analysis

```python
from src.valuation import perform_what_if_analysis

# Define property modifications
modifications = {
    'square_feet': 2500,  # Expanded the house
    'bathrooms': 3,       # Added a bathroom
    'lot_size': 0.3       # Larger lot
}

# Perform what-if analysis
result = perform_what_if_analysis(property, modifications)

# Access the results
original_value = result['original_valuation']['estimated_value']
new_value = result['adjusted_valuation']['estimated_value']
value_increase = result['total_impact_value']
percentage_increase = result['total_impact_percent']

# Get individual impacts
bathroom_impact = result['parameter_impacts']['bathrooms']['impact_value']
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the valuation engine include:
1. Time series analysis for temporal market trends
2. Integration with real MLS data sources
3. Image analysis for property condition assessment
4. Automated comparable property selection
5. More sophisticated spatial analysis with advanced GIS features
